How This Works
useState(false) → Keeps track of whether the menu is fixed or not.
useEffect Hook → Listens for scroll events.
window.scrollY > 100 → When scrolled past 100px, the navbar gets a fixed position with a shadow effect.
Tailwind Classes Used:
fixed top-0 left-0 w-full → Makes the menu sticky at the top.
shadow-md → Adds a shadow for better visibility.
bg-white → Background turns white when fixed.
transition-all duration-300 → Smooth transition effect.
